# If set, a command name that is the name of a directory is executed as if it
# were the argument to the cd command.
shopt -s autocd

# If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command
# will be corrected. The errors checked for are transposed characters, a missing
# character, and a character too many. If a correction is found, the corrected
# path is printed, and the command proceeds.
shopt -s cdspell

# If this is set, Bash checks that a command found in the hash table exists
# before trying to execute it. If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal
# path search is performed.
shopt -s checkhash

# If set, Bash lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before exiting
# an interactive shell. If any jobs are running, this causes the exit to be
# deferred until a second exit is attempted without an intervening command.
# The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped.
shopt -s checkjobs

# If set, Bash attempts spelling correction on directory names during word
# completion if the directory name initially supplied does not exist.
shopt -s dirspell

# If set, Bash includes filenames beginning with a ‘.’ in the results of filename
# expansion. The filenames ‘.’ and ‘..’ must always be matched explicitly, even
# if dotglob is set.
shopt -s dotglob

# If set, the extended pattern matching features are enabled.
#  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html#Pattern-Matching
shopt -s extglob

# If set, the pattern ‘**’ used in a filename expansion context will match all
# files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is
# followed by a ‘/’, only directories and subdirectories match.
shopt -s globstar

# If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value of the
# HISTFILE variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.
shopt -s histappend

# If set, and Readline is being used, Bash will not attempt to search the PATH
# for possible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.
shopt -s no_empty_cmd_completion

# If set, Bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing
# filename expansion.
shopt -s nocaseglob

# If set, Bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when performing
# matching while executing case or [[ conditional commands, when performing
# pattern substitution word expansions, or when filtering possible completions
# as part of programmable completion.
shopt -s nocasematch

# If set, and programmable completion is enabled, Bash treats a command name that
# doesn’t have any completions as a possible alias and attempts alias expansion.
# If it has an alias, Bash attempts programmable completion using the command word
# resulting from the expanded alias.
